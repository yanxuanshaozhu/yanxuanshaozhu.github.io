<li>Highways driving
<ul>
<li>Highway speed limits are usually between 45 to 65 mph</li>
<li>Some highways cross other roads and are controlled by traffic
signals. Others are controlled access, which means they have no signals
or intersections. Theses highways are called expressways or freeways,
and you enter or exit these highways at interchanges.</li>
<li>In MA, Routes 90 and State Highway 128 are examples of
expressways</li>
<li>Be suer to signal your exit at least 500 feet before you reach the
exit ramp. If you miss your exit, do not stop. Never back up on the
highway</li>

red only if you are turning from a one-way street onto another one-way
street</li>
<li>U-turns: you cannot make a u-turn where you cannot see 500 feet
away</li>
<li>Three-point turn: when there is not enough space for a u-turn, you

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Right-or-way rules
<ul>
<li>Right-of-way rules help drivers handle traffic situations not
controlled by signs or signals, these rules are based on safety and
courtesy. If another driver does not follow these rules, you should
always give the right-of-way</li>
<li>Pedestrians: you must always yield to pedestrians who are in the
roadway</li>
<li>Intersections not controlled by signs or signals: you must yield the
right-of-way to any vehicle that has entered the intersection from your
right or is coming from your right, look for traffic coming from the
left, although you may have the legal right-of-way</li>
<li>Four-way stop: you must yield the right-of-way to another vehicle
that has already come to a full stop, or a vehicle directly to your
right that has stopped at the same time as you</li>
<li>Turning left: you must yield the right-of-way to any oncoming
vehicle, vehicle already in the intersection, pedestrians or bicyclists
crossing you intended path of travel</li>

right-of-way to pedestrians, bicyclists, or vehicles on the road you are
entering</li>

throughway before you turn</li>
<li>Rotaries: traffic travels counter-clockwise in a rotary, always
yield the right-of-way to vehicles already in the rotary, you must enter

must use the middle and left lanes for passing</li>
<li>If you are crossing a broken yellow line to pass, you must be able
to see clearly at least 400 feet in front of you</li>
<li>Passing on the right is only allowed in certain circumstances: the
vehicle you are passing is making, or is about to make, a left turn; you
are driving on a one-way street, you are driving on a road where traffic
moves in one direction</li>
<li>If you are being passed, you must slow down and stay to the

<li>Large vehicles need more distance to stop than an automobile or a
motorcycle, do not drive into the space immediately surrounding a large
vehicle</li>
<li>Driving too slowly: on a multiple-lane highway, trucks and busses
can only drive in the two right-hand lanes</li>

ownership</li>
<li>When you buy a vehicle, the seller must give you his or her original
title after printing and signing his or her name on it and entering the
sale price and the required odometer information at the time of
transfer. Buyers are also required to sign and print their names</li>
<li>You must present the title to RMV with your application for a new
title</li>
<li>Original title fee $75</li>
<li>Obtaining an original title: if you are registering your vehicle
when you apply for a title, an authorized MA insurance agent must stamp
and sign the application to certify your insurance coverage</li>
<li>Obtaining a duplicate title: eligible customers with no lien on the
vehicle, can apply for a duplicate title online at Mass.Gov/RMV</li>
<li>Obtaining a salvage-related title: a vehicle is deemed salvage when
an insurance company has declared it to be a total loss due to fire,
vandalism, collision, theft, flood, or any other cause</li>
<li>Once a vehicle has been given salvage classification, the
classification is permanent and remains part of the vehicle's
history</li>
<li>A vehicle with a salvage title cannot be registered</li>
<li>All fees are subject to change at any time</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When you sell a vehicle
<ul>
<li>You must sign the certificate of title over to the new owner and
either cancel the registration and recycle or destroy the plates, or
transfer the plates to another vehicle you own according to the
seven-day registration transfer law</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Insurance and merit rating
<ul>
<li>Compulsory insurance coverage:
<ul>
<li>Bodily injury to others: minimum $20000 per person, $40000 per
crash</li>
<li>Personal injury protection: pays up to $8000 to you, passengers,
pedestrians, or anyone you allow to drive your vehicle</li>
<li>Bodily injury caused by an uninsured auto: minimum $20000 per
person, $40000 per crash</li>
<li>Damage to someone else's property: minimum $5000 for property
damage</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Your driving record will always be an important factor in
determining how much you will pay for auto insurance</li>
<li>Insurers may use the point-based system or their own merit rating
plan to determine discounts for safe drivers an surcharges for drivers
with at-fault crashes and traffic violations</li>
</ul></li>
